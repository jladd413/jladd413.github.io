    <div class="pub-description">While the solution space for software development is constantly
      updated with new technologies, the requirements and artifacts of the problem space can
      appear to be timeless. Even with cutting edge technologies like the AWS serverless stack,
      software developers are still burden with vintage entities like document and image files.
      The patterns presented in this paper cover uploading documents to a private S3 bucket by
      multiple users, allowing read access to a subset of the user population, and manipulating
      the documents in a serverless realm.

    <div class="pub-description">The Common Access Card (CAC) is a “smart” card and provides standard
      identification for active and reserve military personnel, Department of Defense civilian employees,
      and eligible contractors.  The paper describes three cloud-based architectures that were developed
      to integrate the CAC in the security service of a web application.  The first two versions relied
      on NGINX, Docker, and AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).  The latest version is based on AWS
      serverless stack including API Gateway, Lambda, and S3.  All of the versions used GitLab and
      its CI/CD pipeline service.

    <div class="pub-description">The Physiological Analysis Tool (PAT) was a recent proof-of-concept project 
        at SOFWERX that explored the limits of hosting multiple physiological and sentiment analysis systems
        on an on-body computing platform.  Five different sentiment-based systems along with three physiological 
        measurement tools were incorporated into a system that can concurrently analyze the same event.  
        To accommodate this wide spectrum of technologies, a heterogeneous platform was developed that integrates 
        Android, Ubuntu, and Windows computing environments with two point-to-point cable-based connections.   
        The architecture of this system is presented in this document.

    <div class="pub-description">This project presents a serverless implementation of a notes management application.
        We started with the example from the Serverless Stack guide and evolved it to fit our requirements.  The client
        project uses Nodejs, React, Amplify, and CloudFront while the service project utilizes Cognito, API Gateway,
        Lambda, DynamoDB, and Python. The two projects are maintained in GitLab and uses its CI/CD pipeline feature.
        This project deviated from the Serverless Stack guide in the use of GitLab instead of GitHub and Python instead
        of Nodejs for the Lambda language.

    <div class="pub-description">The Clockwerx project started with the desire to program a set of wall mounted clocks via a web
        application. After a false start, the architecture was refactored to include a web application based on a
        React stack to provide a user interface. A web service based on a Flask stack was selected to provide the
        interface to the clock display mechanism. Both of these services are embedded in Docker containers
        and hosted on a Raspberry Pi computer. This document presents an overview of the architecture and
        several tips and details for building out a similar system.

    <div class="pub-description">Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) processes have been at the forefront of the
        software development industry for several years now. While CI/CD concepts are easy to grasp, they can
        be difficult to implement while maintaining schedules and achieving milestones. This paper describes
        our initial steps toward a CI/CD pipeline for our client facing websites that use WordPress and
        SiteGround. We incorporate GitHub’s repository to maintain our source code while using GitHub’s
        Actions service to automate the deployment to a staging environment hosted by SiteGround.

      <div class="pub-description">A recent project at SOFWERX relied on IR to remotely control a target 
        device. In theory, the approach was attractive but, in practice, the original version proved to 
        be unreliable.  This paper describes an approach to increase the stability of this type of computer 
        interface by validating the IR signal transmission using python custom code and the Linux Infrared 
        Remote Control (LIRC) software.

      <div class="pub-description">The ATAK Low Latency Camera Platform (ALLCaP) is a proof of concept

          approach does not rely on signaling, discovery, or intermediary servers and can be used
          with Wi-Fi or software defined radio (SDR) radios.  The project uses the Android Team

      mechanism to mimic the characteristics of different vehicles. The LE’s general locomotion can subtend
      all the trajectories important to navigational research. This paper discusses the need for such a
